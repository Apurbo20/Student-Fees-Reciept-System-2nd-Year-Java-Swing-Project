# Student-Fees-Reciept-System-2nd-Year-Java-Swing-Project
# This project was developed by me & my best friend Sadia Sultana Meem{(meem155)-Github} with Java Swing(GUI).
### Student money receipt system is a system where we(user) will take input of basic informations of a student for giving a total amount of tution fees for the batch & courses.Then these inputs will generate a copy of money receipt for the student & it can also be printed. We used some adavance features to make it as user friendly as possible with JaVa Swing(GUI).
